## Setting permissions on the home directory

In order to install Outlands to Home instead of the bottle itself, we need to allow Bottles to access the Home directory. The advantage of installing to Home is that it's easy to access if you need to edit/delete files, copy or backup profiles, etc.

Open the Flatseal app and select Bottles from the left side.
